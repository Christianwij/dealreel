# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement End-to-End Testing and Deployment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up comprehensive testing, monitoring, and deployment pipelines for the entire application to ensure reliability and performance.
# Details:
1. Set up Jest for frontend testing:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
```

2. Configure Jest in package.json:
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "^@/components/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/components/$1",
      "^@/pages/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/pages/$1",
      "^@/lib/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/lib/$1"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Set up Pytest for backend testing:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx
```

4. Create sample tests:
```typescript
// __tests__/components/UploadComponent.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import UploadComponent from '@/components/UploadComponent';

describe('UploadComponent', () => {
  it('renders the upload area', () => {
    render(<UploadComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText(/drag and drop/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  it('validates file types', async () => {
    render(<UploadComponent />);
    
    const file = new File(['dummy content'], 'test.txt', { type: 'text/plain' });
    const dropzone = screen.getByTestId('dropzone');
    
    fireEvent.drop(dropzone, {
      dataTransfer: {
        files: [file]
      }
    });
    
    expect(await screen.findByText(/file type not supported/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

```python
# tests/test_document_parser.py
import pytest
from app.services.document_parser import parse_pdf, parse_pptx, parse_docx

def test_parse_pdf():
    # Create a test PDF file
    test_file = "tests/fixtures/test_document.pdf"
    result = parse_pdf(test_file)
    
    assert isinstance(result, list)
    assert len(result) > 0
    assert "page_num" in result[0]
    assert "text" in result[0]

# Similar tests for parse_pptx and parse_docx
```

5. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions:
