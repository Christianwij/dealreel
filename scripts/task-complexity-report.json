      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement End-to-End Testing and Deployment' task into 8 detailed subtasks covering: 1) Frontend unit testing setup, 2) Backend unit testing setup, 3) Integration testing implementation, 4) CI pipeline configuration, 5) CD pipeline for frontend, 6) CD pipeline for backend, 7) Monitoring and error tracking setup, and 8) Documentation and runbooks creation. For each subtask, include specific implementation steps, required dependencies, and acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (9/10) because it involves multiple technical domains (frontend, backend, DevOps), requires integration of various testing frameworks (Jest, Pytest), CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions), deployment to multiple platforms (Vercel, Render), and implementation of monitoring systems (Sentry). The task has dependencies on all previous tasks (1-11) and requires comprehensive knowledge of the entire application architecture. The detailed code snippets and configuration files indicate significant implementation work across the full technology stack."
